# TODO

- Fix issue where you can fall faster than camera can keep up 
- Add butter counter to go with the tween. Think like Zelda hearts. Might need an entire Collection Manager
- Zoom out a bit more to see the level
- Tweak jump mechanics
- Tweak wall slide mechanics
- Allow player to climb up single vertical wall
- Add more obstacles besides spikes
- Add intro, bosses, story, and the actual thing that makes it a game...
- Add proper end game screen
- Change from selecting a button on the screen to pressing a button or key instead. Think like Y for reset and A for next level
- Add ability to peak around level
